## Redeem GCP Coupon

This will be handed out at the start of the tutorial. You'll need to go to the following link to redeem the coupon:

[https://console.cloud.google.com/education](https://console.cloud.google.com/education)

I do not recommend redeeming this on your campus gmail if that is what you have as I know my campus google services are configured to not allow google cloud usage by default.

### Redeeming Coupon

Clicking on that link will povide a dialog that looks like below:

![GCP Redemption](https://github.com/javawolfpack/CCSC-Tutorial/raw/main/assets/GCP_application.png "Figure 1: GCP Redemption")

In this form you should make sure you have your name and enter the GCP coupon that was handed out at the start of this tutorial.
